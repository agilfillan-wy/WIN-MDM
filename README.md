Windows 10 / 11 Multi-app Kiosk and MDM tips and tricks

The techniques and registry entries here are not well documented.  I would suggest backing up your registry and comptuer before attempting them.  If you are using Hyper-V for testing I would recommend adding the standard user account to the "Remote Desktop Users" and "Hyper-V Administrators" during testing in KIOSK mode, otherwise you will just be logged out as soon as you are logged in.
